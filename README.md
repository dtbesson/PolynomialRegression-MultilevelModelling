# PolynomialRegression-MultilevelModelling

This is another quick university laboratory project, where we use the inbuilt Gapminder data in R, as well as the attached school.dta file to practise:
-  Creating polynomial regression models
-  Including interaction terms
-  A first look at multilevel modelling
